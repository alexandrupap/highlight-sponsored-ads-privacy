        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This Chrome extension, referred to as "the Extension," is designed
            solely to highlight sponsored ads on Google search result pages. It
            does not collect, store, or process any personal data or information
            from users.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>
            The Extension does not collect any personal or usage data. It
            functions entirely on your device and does not send any information
            to external servers or third parties.
        </p>

        <h2>Permissions</h2>
        <p>
            The Extension requires minimal permissions only to interact with the
            content of Google search result pages to highlight sponsored ads.
            This is necessary to achieve its functionality and does not involve
            any data collection.
        </p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>No third-party services are used within the Extension.</p>
